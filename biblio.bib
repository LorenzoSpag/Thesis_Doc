 abstract = {Methods of evaluating and comparing the performance of diagnostic tests are of increasing importance as new tests are developed and marketed. When a test is based on an observed variable that lies on a continuous or graded scale, an assessment of the overall value of the test can be made through the use of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The curve is constructed by varying the cutpoint used to determine which values of the observed variable will be considered abnormal and then plotting the resulting sensitivities against the corresponding false positive rates. When two or more empirical curves are constructed based on tests performed on the same individuals, statistical analysis on differences between curves must take into account the correlated nature of the data. This paper presents a nonparametric approach to the analysis of areas under correlated ROC curves, by using the theory on generalized U-statistics to generate an estimated covariance matrix.},

	Abstract = {Radiomics, the high-throughput mining of quantitative image features from standard-of-care medical imaging that enables data to be extracted and applied within clinical-decision support systems to improve diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive accuracy, is gaining importance in cancer research. Radiomic analysis exploits sophisticated image analysis tools and the rapid development and validation of medical imaging data that uses image-based signatures for precision diagnosis and treatment, providing a powerful tool in modern medicine. Herein, we describe the process of radiomics, its pitfalls, challenges, opportunities, and its capacity to improve clinical decision making, emphasizing the utility for patients with cancer. Currently, the field of radiomics lacks standardized evaluation of both the scientific integrity and the clinical relevance of the numerous published radiomics investigations resulting from the rapid growth of this area. Rigorous evaluation criteria and reporting guidelines need to be established in order for radiomics to mature as a discipline. Herein, we provide guidance for investigations to meet this urgent need in the field of radiomics.},

ABSTRACT = {Background: COVID assessment can be performed using the recently developed individual risk score (prediction of severe respiratory failure in hospitalized patients with SARS-COV2 infection, PREDI-CO score) based on High Resolution Computed Tomography. In this study, we evaluated the possibility of automatizing this estimation using semi-supervised AI-based Radiomics, leveraging the possibility of performing non-supervised segmentation of ground-glass areas. Methods: We collected 92 from patients treated in the IRCCS Sant’Orsola-Malpighi Policlinic and public databases; each lung was segmented using a pre-trained AI method; ground-glass opacity was identified using a novel, non-supervised approach; radiomic measurements were collected and used to predict clinically relevant scores, with particular focus on mortality and the PREDI-CO score. We compared the prediction obtained through different machine learning approaches. Results: All the methods obtained a well-balanced accuracy (70\%) on the PREDI-CO score but did not obtain satisfying results on other clinical characteristics due to unbalance between the classes. Conclusions: Semi-supervised segmentation, implemented using a combination of non-supervised segmentation and feature extraction, seems to be a viable approach for patient stratification and could be leveraged to train more complex models. This would be useful in a high-demand situation similar to the current pandemic to support gold-standard segmentation for AI training.},

 abstract = {In multiple regression it is shown that parameter estimates based on minimum residual sum of squares have a high probability of being unsatisfactory, if not incorrect, if the prediction vectors are not orthogonal. Proposed is an estimation procedure based on adding small positive quantities to the diagonal of X′X. Introduced is the ridge trace, a method for showing in two dimensions the effects of nonorthogonality. It is then shown how to augment X′X to obtain biased estimates with smaller mean square error.},
